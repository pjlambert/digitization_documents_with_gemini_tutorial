Our intercom-municating battery phones are intended for just this kind of service, where the distance between telephones is not great, but the number of times you want to talk between these points will make these telephones a great convenience.\nRun a telephone line to your neighbor's house if the distance is short. Enjoy a friendly chat in your leisure moments when the time or weather makes a personal visit impracticable.\nThese telephones are easily installed and directions are furnished with each instrument. You will be delighted to find how easily these telephones can be put up and connected and with the resulting conveniences.
